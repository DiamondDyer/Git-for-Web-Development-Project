Stretch Questions

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

	The box model is a box around all html elements that consists of margin, borders, padding, and content. The problem with the box model is that it adds padding and borders on top of the elements. We can fix this with box-sizing:border-box. This includes padding and borders in an element's width.
